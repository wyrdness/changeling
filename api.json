      "summary": "A fairy child left in place of a stolen human child. Changelings were believed to explain infant illness, developmental disorders, and postpartum conditions before modern medicine.",
      "full": "A changeling is a fairy offspring that has been secretly left in place of a human child, typically an infant. According to folklore, fairies would steal healthy human babies and replace them with their own children, who would appear sickly, strange in behavior, fail to develop normally, eat voraciously, or have an unnaturally old appearance. This belief was widespread in Celtic and Germanic folklore and tragically led to child abuse and deaths when parents used cruel tests to 'reveal' or banish the supposed changeling. Modern understanding recognizes that changeling beliefs were used to explain conditions like autism, Down syndrome, developmental delays, and other medical conditions before modern medicine."
